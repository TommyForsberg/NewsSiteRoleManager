ASP-Core 2.0 lab with Identity, roles, policies and claims.

The application only makes sense with the console log open in your browser. A user is signed in using the Identity framwork with the login button. With the different buttons you can then check if the user has access to different actions. The action will either return status 200 (Ok) or 403 (forbidden).
